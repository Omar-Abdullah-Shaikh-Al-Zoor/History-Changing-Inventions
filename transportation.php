                            <p class="text">&emsp; &emsp;Prior to the advent of the wheel, people used to transport and
                                ship their
                                goods from one location to another by
                                carrying them or utilizing animals such as horses and donkeys. People employed simple
                                innovations such as rollers and sleds
                                to assist them carry large objects. Those fundamental technologies were used to
                                construct the magnificent pyramids of Giza,
                                one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. The invention of wheels during the Bronze
                                age resulted in a major quantum leap
                                in human history. The first wheeled vehicle was a small two-wheel chariots that could
                                only transport one person at a time,
                                and it was drawn by a horse. The size of the chariot grew over time to accommodate more
                                passengers and items. Centuries
                                later, the railways came into exist in Greece about 600 BCE. These rails were used to
                                transport slave-powered boats. The
                                utilization of wheels developed over centuries, and many other innovations had been
                                constructed until the first horseless
                                carriage/Automobile was invented in 1769 (Wei, 2012, p. 200-201).

                            <p class="text">&emsp; &emsp; In 1769, Nicolas Joseph Cugnot built a three wheeled
                                automobile, which was powered by the steam. That concept had several flaws, ranging from
                                the car's efficiency to its engine's massive size and dirtiness. Years later, when the
                                brothers Nicephore and Claude Niepce devised an internal combustion engine in 1807, they
                                replaced the notion of employing a steam driven engine with a gasoline powered engine.
                                The combustion/gasoline engine, which is fueled by Gasoline, had gone through several
                                stages of improvement and development before Karl Friedrich Benz built the first working
                                vehicle in 1885. Benz's automobile could attain a top speed of 15 kilometers per hour.
                                Gottlieb Daimler produced his first vehicle four years later, in 1889, for $850, which
                                was extraordinarily costly at the time. Nine years later, Henry Ford created the Model T
                                vehicle for the mainstream market, which cost only $250. Since then, the vehicle
                                industry has grown considerably, and it is now the second largest capital investment for
                                American households, after the house. Furthermore, there are more than two-thirds of
                                Americans have a driver's license. On the other hand, there is growing concern about how
                                these internal combustion engines are affecting the environment and contributing to
                                global warming (Wei, 2012, p. 202-205).</p>

                            <p class="text">&emsp; &emsp; Since ancient times, humans have always desired the ability to
                                fly like birds and eagles. At that time, human's ability to fly alongside birds was only
                                seen in Greek Myths and Chinese poetry, and no one expected these delusory fancies to
                                come true one day (Wei, 2012, p. 202-205; Falk, 2013, p. 155). Years before the first
                                airplane was built, the dream of rising to the air was achieved when hot air balloon was
                                made by the brothers Joseph-Michel and Jacques-Etienne Montgolfier in the capital of
                                France, Paris, during the late 18th century (Wei, 2012, p. 216; Falk, 2013, p. 156). A
                                century later, the Wright brothers succeeded in developing the first flying machine.
                                Surprisingly, their researches and testing machines are still used to create modern4
                                airplanes. However, because the Wright brothers could not locate a suitable engine for
                                their innovations, they built their own engine that allowed the plane's rider to fly for
                                no more than a few minutes. That is why the airplane innovation went through various
                                stages before reaching its current state. This innovation led to enormous number of
                                discoveries such as the discovery of Venezuela's largest waterfall and ancient geoglyphs
                                such as Peru's Nazca Lines (Wei, 2012, p. 223; Falk, 2013, p. 156).</p>
