                    <h2>The inventions of the Wheels</h2>
                    <img src="assets/media/carriage_desktop.jpg" alt="Carriage picture" />
                    <p>Prior to the advent of the wheel, people used to transport and ship their goods from one
                        location to another by carrying them or utilizing animals such as horses and donkeys. People
                        employed simple innovations such as rollers and sleds to assist them carry large objects. Those
                        fundamental technologies were used to construct the magnificent pyramids of Giza, one of the
                        seven wonders of the ancient world. The invention of wheels during the Bronze age resulted in a
                        major quantum leap in human history. The first wheeled vehicle was a small two-wheel chariots
                        that could only transport one person at a time, and it was drawn by a horse. The size of the
                        chariot grew over time to accommodate more passengers and items. Centuries later, the railways
                        came into exist in Greece about 600 BCE. These rails were used to transport slave-powered
                        boats. The utilization of wheels developed over centuries, and many other innovations had been
                        constructed until the first horseless carriage/Automobile was invented in 1769 (Wei, 2012, p.
                        200-201).</p>

                    <h2>From Wagon to automobile</h2>
                    <img src="assets/media/automobile_desktop.jpg" alt="Old Automobile picture">
                    <p>In 1769, Nicolas Joseph Cugnot built a three wheeled automobile, which was powered by
                        the steam. That concept had several flaws, ranging from the car's efficiency to its engine's
                        massive size and dirtiness. Years later, when the brothers Nicephore and Claude Niepce devised
                        an internal combustion engine in 1807, they replaced the notion of employing a steam driven
                        engine with a gasoline powered engine. The combustion/gasoline engine, which is fueled by
                        Gasoline, had gone through several stages of improvement and development before Karl
                        Friedrich Benz built the first working vehicle in 1885. Benz's automobile could attain a top speed
                        of 15 kilometers per hour. Gottlieb Daimler produced his first vehicle four years later, in 1889,
                        for $850, which was extraordinarily costly at the time. Nine years later, Henry Ford created the
                        Model T vehicle for the mainstream market, which cost only $250. Since then, the vehicle
                        industry has grown considerably, and it is now the second largest capital investment for
                        American households, after the house. Furthermore, there are more than two-thirds of Americans
                        have a driver's license. On the other hand, there is growing concern about how these internal
                        combustion engines are affecting the environment and contributing to global warming (Wei,
                        2012, p. 202-205).</p>

                    <h2>Flying alongside with birds: <em>Airplane</em></h2>
                    <img src="assets/media/airplane_desktop.jpg" alt="Wright flight picture" />
                    <p>Since ancient times, humans have always desired the ability to fly like birds and eagles.
                        At that time, human's ability to fly alongside birds was only seen in Greek Myths and Chinese
                        poetry, and no one expected these delusory fancies to come true one day (Wei, 2012, p. 202-205;
                        Falk, 2013, p. 155). Years before the first airplane was built, the dream of rising to the air was
                        achieved when hot air balloon was made by the brothers Joseph-Michel and Jacques-Etienne
                        Montgolfier in the capital of France, Paris, during the late 18th century (Wei, 2012, p. 216; Falk,
                        2013, p. 156). A century later, the Wright brothers succeeded in developing the first flying
                        machine. Surprisingly, their researches and testing machines are still used to create modern4
                        airplanes. However, because the Wright brothers could not locate a suitable engine for their
                        innovations, they built their own engine that allowed the plane's rider to fly for no more than a
                        few minutes. That is why the airplane innovation went through various stages before reaching its
                        current state. This innovation led to enormous number of discoveries such as the discovery of
                        Venezuela's largest waterfall and ancient geoglyphs such as Peru's Nazca Lines (Wei, 2012, p.
                        223; Falk, 2013, p. 156).</p>
